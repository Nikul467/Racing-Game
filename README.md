This game involves creating a simple racing simulation using mathematical functions and key principles like interpolation and curvature control.
The track is divided into sections, and the player's movement is governed by real-time adjustments to speed, acceleration, and steering, based on the difference between the player's curvature and the track's curvature.
The game uses basic trigonometric functions, like sine waves, to create the illusion of background scenery moving with the car.
