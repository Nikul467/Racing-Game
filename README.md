# Racing game

This game involves creating a simple racing simulation using mathematical functions and key principles like interpolation and curvature control.
The track is divided into sections, and the player's movement is governed by real-time adjustments to speed, acceleration, and steering, based on the difference between the player's curvature and the track's curvature.
